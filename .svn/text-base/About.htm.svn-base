        We designed this app for health care professionals who treat service members, veterans and their families. It provides you with a set of tools to support resilience and fight burnout and compassion fatigue.
        <p>
        Health care professionals know that they need to take care of themselves and tend to know what to do to fight stress – they just don’t take the time to do it. That’s where this app comes in.</p>
        <p>
            We've developed the tools that providers have asked for to help keep track of how you’re doing, remind you to do the things you know you should, and show you some interesting things to do that support resilience. We even remind you on a daily basis to use the app. It only takes a few minutes a day to take care of yourself.
